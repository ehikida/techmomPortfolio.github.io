          Why do we always introduce ourslves as a "mom of x" first? I'm not
          really sure. I have three children whom I love dearly, but I know that
          I am so much more than just their mom.

          I grew up in Hawaii, and have a deep love for different cultures and
          cuisines. I am a hobby baker. I like to learn new things, and think
          that I will be immediately good. That is rarely the case!

          Ice cream was my introductory job in my career. I worked as a quality
          assurance chemist at an ice cream production facility for about a
          year. I had to do both microbe and taste testing. It took me a year to
          enjoy ice cream again!
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent 6 years as a Quality Assurance Scientist at a nutraceutical
          company. I was the liason for the Australia division for the company.
          Knowledge of the TSA (Australia's equivalent of the FDA) was
          essential.
